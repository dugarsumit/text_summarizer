Illegal immigration comes heavy on the nation's economy, and that's something which has been proved time and again. Whilst going through the history of illegal immigration in the United States you come across numerous instances wherein federal government has been severely criticized for allowing the illegal practice to go on unabated. Illegal immigration facts and statistics compiled over the last few decades also speak in volumes about the federal government's inability to stop this practice. Estimates suggest that there are somewhere between 9-20 million illegal immigrants in the United States as of today. As the effects of illegal immigration continue to become more and more obvious, one can't help, but wonder how it all began.

Reality of Illegal Immigration: A Historical Perspective.

Immigration in the United States of America began way back when humans migrated from Asia to North America during the Ice Age. In a true sense though, the continent was introduced to Europeans only after Christopher Columbus discovered it in the 15th century. Other than the mass immigration following Columbus' visit, large scale immigration in America was also recorded in 18th and 19th century. While 15th century immigration was restricted to Europeans, the United States had become a sought after destination for people from all over the world by the beginning of 19th century. It was during this period that a large number of people from Asian countries came to America.

As large scale immigration began to pose problems for the economy, President Chester A. Arthur passed the Chinese Exclusion Act which put a ban on the entry of Chinese immigrants in the United States. Before this, the federal government had passed a law which banned the entry of convicts and prostitutes in the nation, but that didn't make waves like President Arthur's decision to bring an end to Chinese immigration did. Arthur followed this decision with a new law which barred the entry of criminals.                    
