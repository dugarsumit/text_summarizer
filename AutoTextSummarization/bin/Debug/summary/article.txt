Sachin Tendulkar is supposed to be the God of cricket. His shot selection and his body movements are considered to copy the text book when he is in full flow. He is nearing 40 but his excellence never touches the ground rather it steps a step up as the day passes. He has more than 30000 runs and more than 150 wickets in international cricket. Records do not contend him, he thirsts for more. Nick named "The Little Master". He learns, he does.
